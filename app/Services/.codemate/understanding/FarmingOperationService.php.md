This PHP service class, `FarmingOperationService`, provides a method to retrieve a paginated list of farming operations filtered, sorted, and transformed based on HTTP request parameters. 

Key functionalities include:
- Filtering operations by type, status (active, completed, planned), and location.
- Sorting results by a specified field and order, defaulting to season start date descending.
- Paginating the results with a configurable number of items per page.
- Transforming each operation into a structured array containing key details such as ID, name, type, acreage, season dates and length, expected yield and unit, commodity price, location, status (derived from operation state), costs, and timestamps.

This service facilitates flexible querying and formatting of farming operation data for use in APIs or other application layers.
