The `FarmingCostCalculator` service class provides comprehensive cost analysis and benchmarking functionalities for farming operations. It integrates with a `CostPredictionService` to enhance cost evaluations with predictive analytics.

Key functionalities include:

- **Total Cost Calculation:** Computes the sum of all costs associated with a given farming operation, with logging for traceability.

- **Cost Analysis with Predictions:** Combines actual costs with predicted costs to perform variance analysis, assess risk levels, and generate actionable recommendations. It handles exceptions and logs errors during analysis.

- **Recommendations Generation:** Produces tailored advice based on budget variance, cost structure (fixed vs variable costs), cost efficiency (e.g., cost per acre), and prediction accuracy to guide operational improvements.

- **Cost Breakdown Formatting:** Transforms cost summary data into a structured format for clearer presentation, including totals, averages, transaction counts, and date ranges per cost category.

- **Operations Benchmarking:** Compares multiple farming operations by calculating key metrics such as total costs, cost per acre, fixed and variable costs, and profit margins. It also computes benchmarks and insights like average costs, most efficient operation, and cost ranges.

- **Weather Data Endpoint Placeholder:** Indicates a planned API endpoint to retrieve weather data for specified locations and date ranges, which could be used to further inform cost and operational decisions.

Overall, this class supports data-driven decision-making in agricultural management by combining actual financial data with predictive modeling and benchmarking insights.
