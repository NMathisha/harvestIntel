The `CostPredictionService` class provides a comprehensive machine learning-based system for predicting farming operation costs by cost category. It integrates data preparation, model training, prediction, fallback estimation, and performance tracking with detailed logging and error handling. Key functionalities include:

1. **Model Training (`trainModelForCategory`)**  
   - Prepares labeled training data from historical farming costs for a specific cost category.  
   - Selects an optimal ML regression model (Ridge regression, Regression Tree, or Gradient Boosting) based on sample size.  
   - Trains the model and validates its performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.  
   - Caches and stores model performance metrics for later use.

2. **Cost Prediction (`predictCostForOperation`)**  
   - Resolves operation and category models and extracts relevant features (e.g., acres, commodity price, historical averages).  
   - Normalizes features and ensures the model for the category is trained.  
   - Predicts cost using the trained model, enforces non-negative predictions, and calculates a confidence score based on historical data similarity and model reliability.  
   - Validates prediction against historical averages to detect anomalies.  
   - Stores prediction records with metadata including model used, confidence, and prediction factors.

3. **Batch Prediction (`predictAllCostsForOperation`)**  
   - Predicts costs for all predictable cost categories for a given farming operation.  
   - Attempts ML prediction per category; if ML fails or insufficient data, falls back to industry-standard cost estimates adjusted for operation specifics (acres, commodity price, yield, region).  
   - Aggregates results with success rates, error tracking, and suggestions for improving data quality.  
   - Uses database transactions to ensure consistency.

4. **Fallback Estimation (`generateFallbackPrediction`)**  
   - Provides default cost estimates per acre by category and operation type based on industry standards.  
   - Applies adjustments for commodity price, expected yield, and regional cost multipliers.  
   - Returns low-confidence estimates with explanatory notes.

5. **Sample Data Generation (`generateSampleData`)**  
   - Creates synthetic historical farming operations and associated costs for testing or initial setup.  
   - Introduces realistic random variations in acres, yield, and prices.  
   - Supports multiple years of sample data generation.

6. **Feature Extraction and Validation (`extractFeaturesForOperation`)**  
   - Extracts numeric features from operations and costs, including weather data and market factors.  
   - Encodes operation type as one-hot features.  
   - Validates and sanitizes feature values.

7. **Model Selection (`selectOptimalModel`)**  
   - Chooses ML model type based on training sample size:  
     - Small datasets: Ridge regression (linear).  
     - Medium datasets: Regression tree.  
     - Large datasets: Gradient boosting with regression trees.

8. **Model Validation (`validateModel`)**  
   - Performs prediction on training data and computes error metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE).  
   - Assesses reliability levels and sets confidence baselines.

9. **Confidence Calculation (`calculateConfidence`)**  
   - Computes confidence score for predictions based on similarity to recent historical costs and model reliability.  
   - Uses statistical measures like z-score and standard deviation.

10. **Prediction Accuracy Update (`updatePredictionAccuracy`)**  
    - Updates stored predictions with actual observed costs and calculates prediction errors.  
    - Logs warnings and can trigger model retraining if errors exceed thresholds.

11. **Utilities and Helpers**  
    - Resolves models from IDs or objects for operations and categories.  
    - Validates operations and features for prediction suitability.  
    - Normalizes features for stable model input.  
    - Estimates when predicted costs are likely to occur within the farming season based on category semantics.  
    - Provides suggestions to improve prediction accuracy by importing historical data or generating sample data.  
    - Calculates regional cost multipliers based on location strings.  
    - Retrieves aggregated model performance statistics cached for efficiency.

Overall, this service encapsulates a robust ML pipeline tailored for agricultural cost prediction, combining data-driven modeling with fallback heuristics and operational safeguards to support decision-making in farming operations.
