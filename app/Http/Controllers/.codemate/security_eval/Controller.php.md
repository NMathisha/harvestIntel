## Recommendations

- **Ensure Proper Use of Authorization and Validation in Child Controllers**  
  While this base controller uses the `AuthorizesRequests` and `ValidatesRequests` traits, it is crucial that any child controllers implement proper authorization checks and input validation to prevent unauthorized access and input-based attacks such as SQL injection or XSS.

- **Keep Dependencies Updated**  
  Ensure that the Laravel framework and its components are kept up to date to benefit from security patches.
