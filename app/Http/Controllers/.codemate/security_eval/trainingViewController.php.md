# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Overview
The provided PHP code is a Laravel controller method that retrieves non-deleted cost categories from the database and returns a paginated view.

## Security Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Issue:** The method `showCategory()` does not accept any user input directly, so there is no immediate risk of injection or manipulation here.
- **Recommendation:** If in the future this method is extended to accept query parameters (e.g., page number, filters), ensure proper validation and sanitization.

### 2. Potential Information Disclosure via Pagination
- **Issue:** Pagination is set to 5 items per page without any access control or user-specific filtering.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure that the data being paginated is appropriate for the authenticated user or role. If this data is sensitive, implement authorization checks to prevent unauthorized access.

### 3. Soft Delete Check Implementation
- **Issue:** The code manually checks for `deleted_at` being null to filter out soft-deleted records.
- **Recommendation:** Use Laravel's built-in SoftDeletes trait and query scopes (`CostCategory::paginate(5)`) which automatically exclude soft-deleted records. This reduces the risk of accidentally exposing deleted data.

### 4. No Authentication or Authorization Checks
- **Issue:** The method does not perform any authentication or authorization checks before returning data.
- **Recommendation:** Implement middleware or explicit checks to ensure only authorized users can access this data.

## Summary
The current code snippet does not contain direct security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or XSS due to the absence of user input handling. However, it lacks authentication and authorization controls, which could lead to unauthorized data exposure. Additionally, better use of Laravel's features for soft deletes and input validation is recommended to improve security posture.
