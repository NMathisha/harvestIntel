The `FarmingCostController` is a Laravel controller responsible for managing farming operations, costs, cost categories, and machine learning-based cost predictions within an agricultural management system. It provides a comprehensive API and web views for CRUD operations, data analysis, and ML model management. Key functionalities include:

1. **Dashboard Statistics (`dashboardStats`)**: 
   - Provides an overview of the system with cached aggregated statistics such as total operations, costs, categories, financial summaries, ML prediction performance, recent activities, cost breakdowns, and monthly spending trends.
   - Includes a data health score assessing data quality based on cost records per operation.

2. **Operations Management**:
   - `getOperations`: Lists farming operations with filtering (by type, status, location), sorting, pagination, and returns either JSON or partial views for AJAX.
   - `showOperation`: Retrieves detailed information about a single operation, including associated costs and cost summaries.
   - `updateOperation`: Validates and updates operation details.
   - `deleteOperation`: Soft deletes an operation.

3. **Costs Management**:
   - `getCosts`: Retrieves costs for a specific operation with filtering by category type and date range, sorting, and summary statistics.
   - `updateCost`: Validates and updates cost records, invalidating related caches.
   - `deleteCost`: Soft deletes a cost record and invalidates related caches.

4. **Cost Categories**:
   - `getCategories`: Lists cost categories with optional filtering by type and predictability.

5. **Cost Prediction and Machine Learning**:
   - `predictCosts`: Generates cost predictions for a given operation using ML models or fallback industry standards, returning a summary view.
   - `costAnalysis`: Compares actual vs predicted costs for an operation, calculating variance and risk levels.
   - `trainModel`: Trains an ML model for a specific cost category, returning training results and actionable recommendations based on feature importance, average predicted cost, and model accuracy.
   - `trainAllModels`: Trains ML models for all predictable cost categories, reporting success rates and individual results.

6. **Comparison and Utilities**:
   - `compareOperations`: Compares multiple operations using the cost calculator service and displays comparative statistics.
   - Helper methods for fetching actual and predicted costs, determining risk levels, and generating training recommendations.

7. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Robust exception handling with appropriate HTTP responses and logging for debugging.

8. **Dependencies**:
   - Uses services like `FarmingCostCalculator` for cost calculations and `CostPredictionService` for ML predictions and training.
   - Relies on Eloquent models: `FarmingOperation`, `FarmingCost`, `CostCategory`, and `CostPrediction`.

Overall, this controller integrates CRUD operations, data aggregation, ML-driven cost prediction, and model training to support efficient farming cost management and decision-making.
