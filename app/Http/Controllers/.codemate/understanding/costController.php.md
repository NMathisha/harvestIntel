This PHP controller class manages farming cost-related operations within an agricultural application. It primarily handles viewing, adding, and retrieving detailed cost entries associated with farming operations and cost categories. Key functionalities include:

1. **Dependencies and Services**: Utilizes services for cost calculation, cost prediction, and weather data integration, injected via the constructor.

2. **Index Method**: Retrieves and paginates active cost categories and farming costs, returning them to a view for display.

3. **Edit Cost Method**: 
   - Validates the existence of farming operations and cost categories before proceeding.
   - Validates incoming request data for adding a new cost, including fields like category, description, amount, date, quantity, and external factors.
   - Checks for duplicate cost entries to prevent redundancy.
   - Calculates unit price if quantity is provided.
   - Uses a database transaction to safely create a new cost record linked to a farming operation.
   - Updates timestamps and clears relevant caches to maintain data integrity and performance.
   - Logs the addition of new costs.
   - Returns detailed JSON responses with success status, cost details, updated operation summaries, and cost recommendations.
   - Handles various error scenarios with appropriate HTTP status codes and informative messages.

4. **Get Cost Method**: 
   - Retrieves a specific cost entry by ID along with its related operation and category.
   - Returns detailed JSON data about the cost.
   - Handles not found and internal errors gracefully with logging and proper responses.

Overall, the controller ensures robust management of farming cost data with comprehensive validation, error handling, caching strategies, and integration with auxiliary services for enhanced functionality.
