The `FarmingCostController` is a Laravel controller designed to manage farming operations, associated costs, cost categories, and machine learning-based cost predictions within an agricultural management system. It integrates CRUD functionalities, data retrieval, analytics, and ML workflows to provide comprehensive management and predictive insights.

**Key Features:**

1. **Dashboard Statistics (`dashboardStats`)**  
   - Aggregates system-wide metrics including counts of operations, costs, categories, financial summaries, ML model performance, recent activities, cost breakdowns, and monthly spending trends.  
   - Implements caching for performance optimization.  
   - Calculates a data health score to assess data quality for ML predictions.

2. **Operations Management**  
   - Lists farming operations with pagination and filters (type, status, location, sorting).  
   - Retrieves detailed information for a single operation along with its costs.  
   - Supports updating operation details with validation.  
   - Enables soft deletion of operations.  
   - Allows side-by-side comparison of multiple operations using a cost calculator service.

3. **Costs Management**  
   - Retrieves costs linked to specific operations, supporting filters by category type and date range.  
   - Supports updating and soft deleting cost records with validation.

4. **Cost Categories**  
   - Retrieves cost categories with optional filters by type and predictability status.

5. **Cost Prediction and Analysis**  
   - Generates cost predictions for operations using ML models or fallback industry standards.  
   - Provides detailed cost analysis comparing actual vs predicted costs, including variance and risk level assessments.  
   - Contains helper methods to fetch actual and predicted costs.  
   - Determines risk levels based on cost variance thresholds.

6. **Machine Learning Model Training**  
   - Trains ML models for individual cost categories, returning training outcomes and actionable recommendations based on feature importance, predicted costs, and model accuracy.  
   - Supports batch training of all predictable cost category models, reporting success rates and errors.

7. **Utilities and Services**  
   - Calculates a data health score reflecting average costs per operation, offering status and improvement recommendations.  
   - Utilizes injected services (`FarmingCostCalculator` and `CostPredictionService`) for cost computations and ML predictions.  
   - Handles exceptions gracefully with logging and appropriate HTTP responses.

Overall, the controller serves as a central hub for managing farming-related data, performing cost analyses, and leveraging machine learning to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency in agricultural cost management.
