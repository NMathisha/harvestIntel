This PHP Laravel controller, `costPredictionController`, manages farming operation data for cost prediction and analysis. It includes two methods:

- `index()`: Fetches a paginated list of active (non-deleted) farming operations and returns the `pages.prediction_cost` view with this data for cost prediction display.

- `showAnalisis()`: Retrieves a similar paginated list of active farming operations and returns the `pages.analyse_cost` view to facilitate cost analysis.

The controller serves to provide relevant farming operation data to the application's cost prediction and analysis interfaces.
