This PHP code defines a controller class `trainingViewController` within a Laravel application. The controller contains a method `showCategory` which retrieves a paginated list of active (non-deleted) cost categories from the `CostCategory` model, limiting the results to 5 per page. It then returns a view named `pages.categoryTraining`, passing the retrieved categories to the view for display.
