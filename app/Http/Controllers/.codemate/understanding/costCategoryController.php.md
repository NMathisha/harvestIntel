This PHP code defines a controller class named `costCategoryController` within a Laravel application. The controller includes a single method, `show()`, which retrieves all non-deleted records from the `CostCategory` model (i.e., entries where the `deleted_at` field is null). It then passes this collection of cost categories to a view named `pages.costcategory` for rendering. The controller is responsible for handling the logic related to displaying cost category data to the user.
