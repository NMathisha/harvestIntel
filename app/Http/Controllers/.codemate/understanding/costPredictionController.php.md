This PHP code defines a Laravel controller named `costPredictionController` within the `App\Http\Controllers` namespace. The controller manages farming operation data related to cost prediction and analysis. It includes two main methods:

1. `index()` - Retrieves a paginated list (5 per page) of non-deleted farming operations from the `FarmingOperation` model and passes this data to the `pages.prediction_cost` view for displaying cost prediction information.

2. `showAnalisis()` - Similarly fetches a paginated list of non-deleted farming operations and passes it to the `pages.analyse_cost` view, which is intended for cost analysis purposes.

Both methods filter out records marked as deleted by checking for `deleted_at` being null, ensuring only active operations are considered.
